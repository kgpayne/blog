Content from guests book, [Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068803-rebel-talent) by Francesca Gino.

Harvard Business School Professor Francesca Gino studies organisations and has found that rebels aren’t always disruptive rule-breakers. Rebels (seen in a positive light) break the rules that stand as barriers to value or progress.

What makes a positive rebel? Good rebels are very clear about reputation and the values that are important to the people they serve (clients, leadership etc.). Once the values of an organisation are clear, there can be greater flexibility in the behaviors that will get you there.

In businesses where rebelliousness is encouraged, people feel trusted and so (paradoxically) exercise better judgement of where and when to rebel.

5 characteristics of rebellious behavior:

- Novelty
    - Bias towards the new and uncomfortable.
    - Stretching yourself.
- Curiosity
    - Asking questions and showing child-like wonder.
    - Curiosity peaks at 5 years old and dissipates thereafter.
    - Studies show jobs kill curiosity, unless it is fostered.
- Perspective
    - Fighting the tendency we have to approach a problem with only one view.
    - Try to see the bigger picture.
- Diversity
    - Not adopting social roles and views that are passed upon us. Look for opportunities to explore and leverage difference.
- Authenticity
    - Being able to bring our views, preferences and thoughts into the conversation.
    - Fighting the tendency to conform to others.
    - Exercise humility and vulnerability.

There is a difference between becoming an expert by learning so much that you are opened up and able to innovate vs. ‘settling in’ to expertise without exercising curiosity and shutting out new perspectives.

Resist the expertise trap. <important>The more experience you accumulate the less likely you are to change your behaviors.</important>

“Wisdom means rejecting the feeling of knowing.”

Stress also narrows our minds to options. E.g. Capt. Sully, who ditched his plane in the Hudson, who never stopped learning despite 100’s of hours of experience. He was able to resist this natural narrowing tendency through force of habit and so to formulate a novel solution to a life threatening situation in only 250 seconds.

Practice ‘plus-ing’. This technique is borrowed from improv, where actors aim to keep a scene going by accepting what has been said before and adding to it; “yes, and”. <important>I accept your idea and I am going to build on it.</important> Too often people either debate or shut down others ideas. Be willing to learn from other people views.

Research shows that <important>our expectations of others change both our behaviors _and_ theirs.</important> We subconsciously treat people differently according to our expectations, and they respond.

E.g. students chosen at random by researchers as ‘high growth potential’ get better grades because teachers subconsciously treat them differently.

Rebels inevitably create conflict - with people who are not practicing open-mindedness. Actually, lack of conflict in an organisation is an indicator of stagnation.

Above all, rebels are shown to be “making the most” of everything they do, in life and in work.
