Here I collect articles, take book notes, build technical
tutorials and generally assemble information that might be <important>useful to my future self</important>.
Whilst the intention of this blog is as a personal knowledge store and a form of
<important>therapy through writing</important>, I hope others might also find information here of interest and use.
