October 2019 marks my first anniversary at Zego, and just as I attempted to do at my 3 month milestone, I have been contemplating my experiences over the last year. A lot has happened at Zego in that time, with much to celebrate. We have outgrown one office, and will soon outgrow our next. We have launched in 3 new countries, and surpassed targets in weeks what would once have taken months. We have restructured our teams thrice and my own role has changed twice. As of today, we are [officially an Insurance Company](https://www.cityam.com/london-startup-zego-gains-first-ever-licence-for-uk-insurtech/). In all these big ways, and in a million smaller ones, Zego has moved on for the better since I started last year.

For my part, the journey has been exhilarating. I came to Zego looking for opportunities to apply what I had learned at Amazon in 'the real world', and in this respect working at Zego has surpassed my every expectation. It will come as no shock to those I work with to say I remain smitten with my previous employer. Whilst jests of mixed loyalties abound, my fondness for Amazon is as a pupil for a favorite teacher rather than ex-employee harking back to 'glory days'. When it comes to "building teams that build things" Amazon has a lot to teach, though ironically I have understood as much about Amazon and its "peculiar ways" from the outside as I did from within. Possibly even more. My overwhelming experience of working at Zego is of 'vuja de', being the opposite of déjà vu.

Déjà vu, translated from French as "already seen", expresses the sensation of seeing something new with a feeling of familiarity, as if the present is nothing but a vivid memory. Vuja de, as described by Adam Grant in Origionals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, is the sensation of seeing something familiar as if for the first time; "with a fresh perspective that enables us to gain new insights". Working at Zego, which has the scope and ambition to rival any Amazon business but without the pillars on which Amazon businesses are built, has afforded me a new perspective by which to view those familiar pillars.

This is not to say that everything I have learned at Zego is somehow rehashed from my Amazon days; far from it. I am challenged on a daily basis by intelligent people solving difficult problems, seemingly without breaking a sweat. I have learned several new toolchains, had help in improving my programming skills and contributed to a technology stack that enables 1000's of new drivers into work every week. Zego was fortunate in its beginnings to find swift success providing flexible insurance for the delivery market, and in the founding product team that built the first iterations of our platform. Since then we have been able to build a thriving business on the foundations they laid. What follows is my experience of this legacy, and my reflections on the challenges yet to be overcome.

Above all, Zego excels in its treatment of people. From the beginning it was clear to me just how much our founders care personally that we be able to produce our best work in a way that is sustainable. Their commitment to individual sustainability is, in my view, what sets Zego apart. For an organisation of our size, where resource is scarce and heroic personal effort has sometimes been the only recourse to meeting lofty goals, this truly is a competitive advantage. Whilst the benefits manifest in many ways, pertinent to me is my first role change. Having expressed an interest in an under-served niche in my team (describable as 'DataOps'), Stu (our technical co-founder) responded by crafting what he called "a Ken shaped hole" in the engineering org. A change that might have taken months or years elsewhere (if at all), happened in days and allowed me to make some of my most valuable contributions at Zego to date. This is codified in our value "We're in this together".

In a small team, this level of individual 'role shaping' is both possible and effective at maximising individual contribution. As the company grows however, the focus necessarily shifts from effective individuals to effective teams; to systematising success. This shift is of great interest to me, and is something my previous employer is renowned for. Most Amazonians will be familiar with the sentiment "good intentions never work, you need good mechanisms to make anything happen” attributed to Jeff himself. Amazon has well-defined mechanisms for hiring (the infamous 'loop'), for ideation (the 'narrative'), for scaling teams (mitosis), for operational planning (OP1/OP2), for building cultural cohesion (the Leadership Principles) and for knowledge management (its internal wiki). These have been honed and refined over decades, across disparate geographies, in scores of industries and have been shown to be incredibly effective. When Amazon is described as relentless it is these mechanisms at the heart of its unrelenting spirit. What I have come to realise is that, in several important ways, the focus of these mechanisms could just as well be bye-products of their value in other and equally challenging domains.

I will use hiring to illustrate my point, though I could just as well have chosen any of the other mechanisms. Hiring at Amazon is considered a core responsibility (as evidenced in [here](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/how-amazon-hires)); everyone is involved, with hiring goals trickling right down to the individual level (even forming part of progression conversations). This broad and deep focus naturally produces extraordinary results, propelling company growth year-on-year-on-year. However, Amazon’s hiring practices have other characteristics that are arguably more important; contributing to what was described to me as an 'upward spiral'. With each new candidate, hired or not, Amazon becomes more both more effective at hiring and more effective at making important group decisions overall. Similar descriptions of successful systems can be found in How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big by Scott Adams or Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

A typical Amazon hiring ‘loop’ (described [here](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/working-at-amazon/whats-it-like-to-interview-at-amazon)) involves interviewers (and trainees who shadow) from both a candidates prospective team and from across the company. Each interviewer is responsible for evaluating a candidate against the company values (the Leadership principles) and recording their detailed, objective feedback. At the end of a loop, a retrospective meeting is held to read and discuss each piece of feedback and to decide on an outcome for the candidate. These ‘debriefs’ are chaired by a ‘bar raiser’ who’s job it is to ensure i) that the candidate raises the wider company bar and ii) that interviewers are being effective in assessing candidates against that bar. This process has 2 important outcomes (in addition to making great hiring decisions):

- It collects people who would otherwise not interact, and jostles them through the ‘teaming’ cycle of “speaking up, collaboration, experimentation and reflection” (from Teaming: How Organizations Learn, Innovate, and Compete in the Knowledge Economy by Amy Edmondson).

- Simply by participating in the uniquely ‘Amazonian’ mechanism, it both connects employees to and helps solidify the companies culture. The importance of shared actions on culture is talked about in detail in Ben Horotwitzs’ new book What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture, with the gist being 'culture is a shared set of behaviors, rather than a shared set of beliefs'.

For a long time I found it very difficult to articulate the feeling of 'convergence of thought' that these mechanisms produce, and its impact on empowering teams to be 'more than the sum of their parts'. Recently I discovered the Japanese have a term that approaches its definition: Ishin-denshin (以心伝心), denoting a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding. Simply by taking part in the companies mechanisms, Amazon employees are coached in the discipline of 'being Amazonian', with the effect that, in a remarkably short period of time, new employees become integrated and able to operate together with their peers on a level that resembles instinct. People exposed to exceptional teams in other arenas, such as competitive sports or the military, will be familiar with the sensation I am describing, but it has always fascinated me that this also be achievable in every-day work; without the extreme conditioning and commitment that other kinds of elite teams demand. This, for me, is the true power of good mechanisms.

In building the "everything store" Amazon has developed several large and far-reaching mechanisms that should be of interest to any organisation striving to achieve Amazon-scale successes. What I have come to understand in the last year is that these mechanisms are analogous to the biological processes that are the prerequisites of consciousness in living organisms. In the same way that having a brain doesn't imply an intellect, mimicking Amazons mechanisms (particularly in part, in isolation or without an understanding of the underlying principles) cannot confer their true benefits on an organisation. I believe we have the opportunity at Zego to use this understanding to build our own mechanisms, and I hope that in my work over my second year (and beyond) to contribute to to applying and spreading the value of systems thinking in service of our teams and our ambitions.
