Seems to be quite a rare little single-burner stove, made for the British Military.
Very similar in design to the US M1950 stove, but with a silent burner from the British Military No. 2 MKII/Modified stove.

TODO:

- Find a spare burner.
    - ~~Will the earlier No.2 roarer work?~~ Nope. It is regulated, but by a fuel-line valve near the tank. There is no space for one in the No. 6 configuration.
- Request "Army Equiptment Support Publication" via the [Ministry of Defence Publication Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-defence/about/publication-scheme) (probably end up routing to [Defence Equiptment and Support](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-equipment-and-support)).

- BernieDawg did a teardown/upgrade of the No. 2 MKII burner [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01H6lF9p8bI). It requires brazing.
