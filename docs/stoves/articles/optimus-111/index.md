Having read good things of the Optimus 111 stoves, I resolved to find one üî•
This hansom 111b came up on eBay, in quite a tired used condition (photos below).
Generally I prefer paraffin burners over petrol ones, as the fuel is less volatile and I have a number of paraffin lamps too, however 111 and 111T variants come up less frequently and command a hefty premium.
Still, I was lucky enough to win this 111b at a reasonable price, and even more so to discover a new old stock (NOS) paraffin burner for it shortly after.
The NOS burner cost more than the stove, but in my view was well worth it.
There can't be too many left in circulation, and a brand new burner affords this stove a like-new service life.
I have serviced the petrol burner anyway, but will likely only ever use it if the paraffin one gives me troubles.

The case was sand-blasted, primed and then painted using engine enamel paint.
This should inhibit rust and resist fuel spills.
Taking no chances, I also installed a sacrificial brass shield in the base of the case to take scratches from the priming cup and to reflect and conduct heat away from the case bottom itself.
Taking no chances on safety-critical components, I replaced the pump leather and non-return valve as well as the tank lid (which includes a pressure-release valve) with brand new parts.
All in all, I am very happy with how this stove has turned out and look forward to putting it to good use ‚òïÔ∏è
