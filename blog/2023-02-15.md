## Improving the Singerlake Spec

In a [previous post](blog/2023-01-17.md) we talked about a potential 'Singerlake' implementation.
This was then discussed both in the [Meltano](https://meltano.com) Slack Channel, and during Meltanos' [Office Hours - 2023-01-18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q20EOoXN8f0).
Several significant improvements came out of those discussions, with special thanks to [@z3z1ma](https://github.com/z3z1ma) who was already thinking about this topic at the time.

### 1. Adding a Manifest

The first suggested improvement was to add some extra metadata.
Our previous spec relies on being able to list all the `.singer.gz` files in a given path when reading from the Singerlake.
However `list` can be a slow and expensive operation in many object storage systems.
Therefore, by adding a manifest (being a list of files) at a predictable place on the Singerlake path, we can short-cut expensive list operations for very little additional complexity.
